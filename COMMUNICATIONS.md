## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide references and information regarding
the communication channels for the OpenSearch Project. All communication is
subject to the [OpenSearch Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please see
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing to the
project.

## Public Slack

OpenSearch has a workspace on [Slack](https://opensearch.slack.com) to provide
public communication channels for all people interested in OpenSearch.

The following guidelines include a Getting Started for steps to register and
setup the workspace along with tips for using the workspace. Please read through
these guidelines carefully and thoroughly. All communications and behavior on
the public slack workspace is subject to the 
[OpenSearch Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Getting Started

_Join Us_

  * Register your account at https://opensearch.slack.com. You will be required
    to enroll in two-factor authentication to ensure the best possible security
    of your account.

_Update Profile_

  * Add your interests or keywords in the “What I do” section of your profile 
    along with your Title and Company/Organization. This is how participants 
    can network and connect with each other by common interests. No anonymous 
    display names are allowed.
  * Feel free to update your profile photo to something unique to you. All 
    profile photos are subject to the 
    [OpenSearch Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) policies.
  * Optionally share your pronouns by adding them to the end of your Full Name 
    in your profile. This way other participants will be able to see them and 
    be respectful to your communication preferences. Please also be respectful 
    of other participants’ pronouns.

### Workspace Channels

After you join OpenSearch workspace you will be automatically added to the 
following channels:

  * **#general** - a channel for asking general questions. Based on the question 
    or discussion users will mostly likely be directed to more specific 
    channels based on the topics of interest.
  * **#random** - consider this the water cooler in a face to face workspace. 
    Feel free to introduce yourself to the community, share what you’re 
    working on, or what you’re excited about learning with OpenSearch.

There are dedicated channels for the following (note that participants might 
be directed to more specific channels based on the nature of the discussion):

  * **#dev** - primary channel for development questions. This is a good place to 
    start for participants interested in OpenSearch development but are not 
    sure which channels to join.  
  * **#core** -  primary channel for core OpenSearch. General questions and 
    discussions about the core can be asked here. 
  * **#dashboards** - primary channel for Dashboards. General questions and 
    discussions about dashboards can be asked here. 
  * **#infra** - primary channel for infra. General discussions, questions, or infra 
    requests can be posted here.
  * **#{project}-build** - dedicated channels where build bots will post failing CI/CD 
    builds for test failure triage and bug fixes.
  * **#maintainers** - a private maintainers channel to discuss new maintainers, and 
    project sensitive topics.

### Tips

  * Try to keep communications in the open - Where possible, try to have 
    conversations in asynchronous formats like GitHub issues, PRs, and discussion 
    forums. 
  * Use the [OpenSearch Discussion Forum](https://forum.opensearch.org) for 
    technical support discussions or, at least, open a summary discussion on the 
    forum so useful findings can be shared with the rest of the community. 
  * Keep discussions organized - use threads to respond to comments inline instead 
    of posting to the entire channel.
  * Expect asynchronous response time - do not assume immediate response time as 
    participants are likely in different time zones.
  * Protecting IP and legally protected information is your responsibility, this is 
    a public forum. Don’t presume anything said here will remain private.
  * **DO NOT** post CVEs or Security issues publicly. See [SECURITY](SECURITY.md)
    for guidelines on handling security issues.
